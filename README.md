# Okta Lab: Group-Based Access + MFA

This lab demonstrates core IAM administration tasks using Okta â€” including user creation, group-based access control, SAML app configuration, and MFA enforcement. The setup was completed within the Okta Admin Console.

## âœ… Step-by-Step Lab Workflow

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Created Test Users
Created two users to simulate employees in different departments:
- `testuser1@Flexpunch.com`
- `testuser2@Flexpunch.com`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Created Two User Groups
Created `Engineering` and `Sales` groups to simulate organizational roles.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Assigned Users to Groups
Assigned:
- `testuser1` to the **Engineering** group

- `testuser2` to the **Sales** group

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Created a Simulated SAML App
Created an app called **Finance Portal** using SAML 2.0 to simulate a protected enterprise application.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Configured SAML Settings
Entered simulated values for SAML settings:
- SSO URL: `https://example.com/sso/acs`
- Entity ID: `https://example.com/sp`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Assigned App to the Engineering Group
Granted access to the Finance Portal app only to the Engineering group.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Created MFA Authentication Policy
Created an MFA policy requiring password + another factor (e.g., Okta Verify) for app access.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Attached Policy to the App
Linked the MFA policy to the Finance Portal app to enforce stronger authentication.
